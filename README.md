## **Title:**  Analyzing Suicide Rates in the United States by Census Regions (1999-2020)

## **Team members:** Eric Matthews, Sean Seaforth, and Woyni Teklay

## Background 
- Suicide is defined as death caused by self-directed injurious behavior with intent to die as a result of the behavior.
- A suicide attempt is a non-fatal, self-directed, potentially injurious behavior with intent to die as a result of the behavior. A suicide attempt might not result in injury.
- Suicidal ideation refers to thinking about, considering, or planning suicide.
- According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) WISQARS Leading Causes of Death Reports, in 2020:
- Suicide was the twelfth leading cause of death overall in the United States, claiming the lives of over 45,900 people.
- Suicide was the second leading cause of death among individuals between the ages of 10-14 and 25-34 , the third leading cause of death among individuals between the ages of 15-24, and the fourth leading cause of death among individuals between the ages of 35 and 44.
- There were nearly two times as many suicides (45,979) in the United States as there were homicides (24,576).<sup>1</sup>
- Suicide is rarely caused by a single circumstance or event. Thus, understanding individual, relationships, community, and societal level factors are necessary to identify protective and risk factors.<sup>2</sup>
